# ProxyChain-Manager
This Python script automates the process of selecting, testing, and configuring proxies for proxychains. It allows you to dynamically select working proxies from a proxy list, configure the proxychains.conf file, and launch an application (like Firefox, Chrome, etc.) through these proxies.
